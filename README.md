# Turbin3 Q4 Builders Cohort

Welcome to the **Turbin3 Q4 Builders Cohort** repository! This repository contains multiple Solana-based projects built using **Anchor Framework**, designed to provide hands-on experience with program development on Solana. Each project focuses on a different use case, from decentralized finance (DeFi) to NFTs and marketplaces.

## ðŸ“Œ Projects Overview

### [Anchor AMM](anchor-amm/README.md)
An **Automated Market Maker (AMM)** protocol built on Solana using Anchor. This project demonstrates how liquidity pools and decentralized trading can be implemented on Solana blockchain.

### [Anchor Escrow](anchor-escrow/README.md)
A **smart contract escrow system** that enables secure transactions between parties by holding funds in a vault until predefined conditions are met.

### [Anchor Marketplace](anchor-marketplace/README.md)
A **decentralized marketplace** where users can list, buy, and sell NFTs or other digital assets. The marketplace integrates listing, purchasing, and delisting mechanisms while handling fees and rewards.

### [Anchor Vault](anchor-vault/README.md)
A **vault system** that allows users to deposit and withdraw SOL securely. It ensures safe fund management using a Solana smart contract.

### [Blinks From Scratch](blinks-from-scratch/README.md)
An **exploration into decentralized social media and content-sharing mechanisms**, focusing on leveraging Solanaâ€™s blockchain to enable permissionless interactions.

### [Capstone](capstone/README.md)
A **final project that integrates multiple concepts** learned throughout the cohort. This project aims to create a full-fledged blockchain application utilizing smart contracts, token mechanics, and user interactions.

### [NFT Staking](nft-staking/README.md)
A **staking mechanism for NFTs** that allows users to lock their NFTs in exchange for rewards over time, demonstrating token incentives and blockchain-based yield mechanics.

## ðŸš€ Get Started
